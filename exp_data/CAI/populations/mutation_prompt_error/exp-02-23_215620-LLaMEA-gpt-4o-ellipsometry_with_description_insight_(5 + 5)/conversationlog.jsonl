Your task is to design novel metaheuristic algorithms to solve black box optimization problems.\nThe optimization algorithm should be able to find high-performing solutions to a wide range of tasks, which include evaluation on real-world applications such as, e.g., optimization of multilayered photonic structures. The ellipsometry problem involves retrieving the material and thickness of a reference layer by matching its reflectance properties using a known spectral response.

Your task is to design novel metaheuristic algorithms to solve black box optimization problems.\nThe optimization algorithm should be able to find high-performing solutions to a wide range of tasks, which include evaluation on real-world applications such as, e.g., optimization of multilayered photonic structures. The ellipsometry problem involves retrieving the material and thickness of a reference layer by matching its reflectance properties using a known spectral response. The optimization minimizes the difference between the calculated and measured ellipsometric parameters for wavelengths between 400 and 800 nm and a fixed incidence angle of 40째. The parameters to be optimized include the thickness (30 to 250 nm) and refractive index (1.1 to 3) of the test layer. This relatively straightforward problem models a practical scenario where photonics researchers fine-tune a small number of parameters to achieve a desired spectral fit. This problem has small parameter space with fewer variables (thickness and refractive index), and the cost function is smooth and relatively free of noise, making it amenable to local optimization methods. Here are suggestions for designing algorithms: 1. Use local optimization algorithms like BFGS or Nelder-Mead, as they perform well in low-dimensional, smooth landscapes. 2. Uniform sampling across the parameter space ensures sufficient coverage for initial guesses. 3. Utilize fast convergence algorithms that can quickly exploit the smooth cost function landscape. 4. Iteratively adjust bounds and constraints to improve parameter estimates once initial solutions are obtained. Your task is to write the optimization algorithm in Python code. The code should contain an `__init__(self, budget, dim)` function and the function `def __call__(self, func)`, which should optimize the black box function `func` using `self.budget` function evaluations.\nThe func() can only be called as many times as the budget allows, not more.

Your task is to design novel metaheuristic algorithms to solve black box optimization problems.\nThe optimization algorithm should be able to find high-performing solutions to a wide range of tasks, which include evaluation on real-world applications such as, e.g., optimization of multilayered photonic structures. The ellipsometry problem involves retrieving the material and thickness of a reference layer by matching its reflectance properties using a known spectral response. The optimization minimizes the difference between the calculated and measured ellipsometric parameters for wavelengths between 400 and 800 nm and a fixed incidence angle of 40째.

This problem has small parameter space with fewer variables (thickness and refractive index), and the cost function is smooth and relatively free of noise, making it amenable to local optimization methods. Here are suggestions for designing algorithms: 1. Use local optimization algorithms like BFGS or Nelder-Mead, as they perform well in low-dimensional, smooth landscapes. 2.

Your task is to design novel metaheuristic algorithms to solve black box optimization problems.\nThe optimization algorithm should be able to find high-performing solutions to a wide range of tasks, which include evaluation on real-world applications such as, e.g., optimization of multilayered photonic structures. The ellipsometry problem involves retrieving the material and thickness of a reference layer by matching its reflectance properties using a known spectral response. The optimization minimizes the difference between the calculated and measured ellipsometric parameters for wavelengths between 400 and 800 nm and a fixed incidence angle of 40째. The parameters to be optimized include the thickness (30 to 250 nm) and refractive index (1.1 to 3) of the test layer. This relatively straightforward problem models a practical scenario where photonics researchers fine-tune a small number of parameters to achieve a desired spectral fit. This problem has small parameter space with fewer variables (thickness and refractive index), and the cost function is smooth and relatively free of noise, making it amenable to local optimization methods. Here are suggestions for designing algorithms: 1. Use local optimization algorithms like BFGS or Nelder-Mead, as they perform well in low-dimensional, smooth landscapes. 2. Uniform sampling across the parameter space ensures sufficient coverage for initial guesses. 3. Utilize fast convergence algorithms that can quickly exploit the smooth cost function landscape. 4. Iteratively adjust bounds and constraints to improve parameter estimates once initial solutions are obtained. Your task is to write the optimization algorithm in Python code.

Your task is to design novel metaheuristic algorithms to solve black box optimization problems.\nThe optimization algorithm should be able to find high-performing solutions to a wide range of tasks, which include evaluation on real-world applications such as, e.g., optimization of multilayered photonic structures. The ellipsometry problem involves retrieving the material and thickness of a reference layer by matching its reflectance properties using a known spectral response. The optimization minimizes the difference between the calculated and measured ellipsometric parameters for wavelengths between 400 and 800 nm and a fixed incidence angle of 40째. The parameters to be optimized include the thickness (30 to 250 nm) and refractive index (1.1 to 3) of the test layer. This relatively straightforward problem models a practical scenario where photonics researchers fine-tune a small number of parameters to achieve a desired spectral fit. This problem has small parameter space with fewer variables (thickness and refractive index), and the cost function is smooth and relatively free of noise, making it amenable to local optimization methods. Here are suggestions for designing algorithms: 1. Use local optimization algorithms like BFGS or Nelder-Mead, as they perform well in low-dimensional, smooth landscapes. 2. Uniform sampling across the parameter space ensures sufficient coverage for initial guesses. 3. Utilize fast convergence algorithms that can quickly exploit the smooth cost function landscape. 4. Iteratively adjust bounds and constraints to improve parameter estimates once initial solutions are obtained. Your task is to write the optimization algorithm in Python code.

Your task is to design novel metaheuristic algorithms to solve black box optimization problems.\nThe optimization algorithm should be able to find high-performing solutions to a wide range of tasks, which include evaluation on real-world applications such as, e.g., optimization of multilayered photonic structures. The ellipsometry problem involves retrieving the material and thickness of a reference layer by matching its reflectance properties using a known spectral response. The optimization minimizes the difference between the calculated and measured ellipsometric parameters for wavelengths between 400 and 800 nm and a fixed incidence angle of 40째.

Uniform sampling across the parameter space ensures sufficient coverage for initial guesses. 3. Utilize fast convergence algorithms that can quickly exploit the smooth cost function landscape. 4.

Your task is to design novel metaheuristic algorithms to solve black box optimization problems.\nThe optimization algorithm should be able to find high-performing solutions to a wide range of tasks, which include evaluation on real-world applications such as, e.g., optimization of multilayered photonic structures. The ellipsometry problem involves retrieving the material and thickness of a reference layer by matching its reflectance properties using a known spectral response.

Your task is to design novel metaheuristic algorithms to solve black box optimization problems.\nThe optimization algorithm should be able to find high-performing solutions to a wide range of tasks, which include evaluation on real-world applications such as, e.g., optimization of multilayered photonic structures. The ellipsometry problem involves retrieving the material and thickness of a reference layer by matching its reflectance properties using a known spectral response. The optimization minimizes the difference between the calculated and measured ellipsometric parameters for wavelengths between 400 and 800 nm and a fixed incidence angle of 40째. The parameters to be optimized include the thickness (30 to 250 nm) and refractive index (1.1 to 3) of the test layer. This relatively straightforward problem models a practical scenario where photonics researchers fine-tune a small number of parameters to achieve a desired spectral fit. This problem has small parameter space with fewer variables (thickness and refractive index), and the cost function is smooth and relatively free of noise, making it amenable to local optimization methods. Here are suggestions for designing algorithms: 1. Use local optimization algorithms like BFGS or Nelder-Mead, as they perform well in low-dimensional, smooth landscapes. 2. Uniform sampling across the parameter space ensures sufficient coverage for initial guesses. 3. Utilize fast convergence algorithms that can quickly exploit the smooth cost function landscape. 4. Iteratively adjust bounds and constraints to improve parameter estimates once initial solutions are obtained. Your task is to write the optimization algorithm in Python code.

Your task is to design novel metaheuristic algorithms to solve black box optimization problems.\nThe optimization algorithm should be able to find high-performing solutions to a wide range of tasks, which include evaluation on real-world applications such as, e.g., optimization of multilayered photonic structures. The ellipsometry problem involves retrieving the material and thickness of a reference layer by matching its reflectance properties using a known spectral response. The optimization minimizes the difference between the calculated and measured ellipsometric parameters for wavelengths between 400 and 800 nm and a fixed incidence angle of 40째. The parameters to be optimized include the thickness (30 to 250 nm) and refractive index (1.1 to 3) of the test layer. This relatively straightforward problem models a practical scenario where photonics researchers fine-tune a small number of parameters to achieve a desired spectral fit. This problem has small parameter space with fewer variables (thickness and refractive index), and the cost function is smooth and relatively free of noise, making it amenable to local optimization methods. Here are suggestions for designing algorithms: 1. Use local optimization algorithms like BFGS or Nelder-Mead, as they perform well in low-dimensional, smooth landscapes. 2. Uniform sampling across the parameter space ensures sufficient coverage for initial guesses. 3. Utilize fast convergence algorithms that can quickly exploit the smooth cost function landscape. 4.

Your task is to design novel metaheuristic algorithms to solve black box optimization problems.\nThe optimization algorithm should be able to find high-performing solutions to a wide range of tasks, which include evaluation on real-world applications such as, e.g., optimization of multilayered photonic structures. The ellipsometry problem involves retrieving the material and thickness of a reference layer by matching its reflectance properties using a known spectral response. The optimization minimizes the difference between the calculated and measured ellipsometric parameters for wavelengths between 400 and 800 nm and a fixed incidence angle of 40째.

This problem has small parameter space with fewer variables (thickness and refractive index), and the cost function is smooth and relatively free of noise, making it amenable to local optimization methods.

Uniform sampling across the parameter space ensures sufficient coverage for initial guesses. 3. Utilize fast convergence algorithms that can quickly exploit the smooth cost function landscape. 4.

Your task is to design novel metaheuristic algorithms to solve black box optimization problems.\nThe optimization algorithm should be able to find high-performing solutions to a wide range of tasks, which include evaluation on real-world applications such as, e.g., optimization of multilayered photonic structures. The ellipsometry problem involves retrieving the material and thickness of a reference layer by matching its reflectance properties using a known spectral response. The optimization minimizes the difference between the calculated and measured ellipsometric parameters for wavelengths between 400 and 800 nm and a fixed incidence angle of 40째.

This problem has small parameter space with fewer variables (thickness and refractive index), and the cost function is smooth and relatively free of noise, making it amenable to local optimization methods.

Your task is to design novel metaheuristic algorithms to solve black box optimization problems.\nThe optimization algorithm should be able to find high-performing solutions to a wide range of tasks, which include evaluation on real-world applications such as, e.g., optimization of multilayered photonic structures. The ellipsometry problem involves retrieving the material and thickness of a reference layer by matching its reflectance properties using a known spectral response. The optimization minimizes the difference between the calculated and measured ellipsometric parameters for wavelengths between 400 and 800 nm and a fixed incidence angle of 40째. The parameters to be optimized include the thickness (30 to 250 nm) and refractive index (1.1 to 3) of the test layer. This relatively straightforward problem models a practical scenario where photonics researchers fine-tune a small number of parameters to achieve a desired spectral fit. This problem has small parameter space with fewer variables (thickness and refractive index), and the cost function is smooth and relatively free of noise, making it amenable to local optimization methods. Here are suggestions for designing algorithms: 1. Use local optimization algorithms like BFGS or Nelder-Mead, as they perform well in low-dimensional, smooth landscapes. 2. Uniform sampling across the parameter space ensures sufficient coverage for initial guesses. 3. Utilize fast convergence algorithms that can quickly exploit the smooth cost function landscape. 4. Iteratively adjust bounds and constraints to improve parameter estimates once initial solutions are obtained. Your task is to write the optimization algorithm in Python code.

Your task is to design novel metaheuristic algorithms to solve black box optimization problems.\nThe optimization algorithm should be able to find high-performing solutions to a wide range of tasks, which include evaluation on real-world applications such as, e.g., optimization of multilayered photonic structures. The ellipsometry problem involves retrieving the material and thickness of a reference layer by matching its reflectance properties using a known spectral response. The optimization minimizes the difference between the calculated and measured ellipsometric parameters for wavelengths between 400 and 800 nm and a fixed incidence angle of 40째.

This problem has small parameter space with fewer variables (thickness and refractive index), and the cost function is smooth and relatively free of noise, making it amenable to local optimization methods. Here are suggestions for designing algorithms: 1. Use local optimization algorithms like BFGS or Nelder-Mead, as they perform well in low-dimensional, smooth landscapes. 2. Uniform sampling across the parameter space ensures sufficient coverage for initial guesses. 3. Utilize fast convergence algorithms that can quickly exploit the smooth cost function landscape. 4.

Your task is to design novel metaheuristic algorithms to solve black box optimization problems.\nThe optimization algorithm should be able to find high-performing solutions to a wide range of tasks, which include evaluation on real-world applications such as, e.g., optimization of multilayered photonic structures. The ellipsometry problem involves retrieving the material and thickness of a reference layer by matching its reflectance properties using a known spectral response. The optimization minimizes the difference between the calculated and measured ellipsometric parameters for wavelengths between 400 and 800 nm and a fixed incidence angle of 40째.

This problem has small parameter space with fewer variables (thickness and refractive index), and the cost function is smooth and relatively free of noise, making it amenable to local optimization methods. Here are suggestions for designing algorithms: 1. Use local optimization algorithms like BFGS or Nelder-Mead, as they perform well in low-dimensional, smooth landscapes. 2. Uniform sampling across the parameter space ensures sufficient coverage for initial guesses. 3. Utilize fast convergence algorithms that can quickly exploit the smooth cost function landscape. 4.

Your task is to design novel metaheuristic algorithms to solve black box optimization problems.\nThe optimization algorithm should be able to find high-performing solutions to a wide range of tasks, which include evaluation on real-world applications such as, e.g., optimization of multilayered photonic structures. The ellipsometry problem involves retrieving the material and thickness of a reference layer by matching its reflectance properties using a known spectral response. The optimization minimizes the difference between the calculated and measured ellipsometric parameters for wavelengths between 400 and 800 nm and a fixed incidence angle of 40째. The parameters to be optimized include the thickness (30 to 250 nm) and refractive index (1.1 to 3) of the test layer. This relatively straightforward problem models a practical scenario where photonics researchers fine-tune a small number of parameters to achieve a desired spectral fit. This problem has small parameter space with fewer variables (thickness and refractive index), and the cost function is smooth and relatively free of noise, making it amenable to local optimization methods. Here are suggestions for designing algorithms: 1. Use local optimization algorithms like BFGS or Nelder-Mead, as they perform well in low-dimensional, smooth landscapes. 2. Uniform sampling across the parameter space ensures sufficient coverage for initial guesses. 3. Utilize fast convergence algorithms that can quickly exploit the smooth cost function landscape. 4. Iteratively adjust bounds and constraints to improve parameter estimates once initial solutions are obtained. Your task is to write the optimization algorithm in Python code.

Your task is to design novel metaheuristic algorithms to solve black box optimization problems.\nThe optimization algorithm should be able to find high-performing solutions to a wide range of tasks, which include evaluation on real-world applications such as, e.g., optimization of multilayered photonic structures. The ellipsometry problem involves retrieving the material and thickness of a reference layer by matching its reflectance properties using a known spectral response. The optimization minimizes the difference between the calculated and measured ellipsometric parameters for wavelengths between 400 and 800 nm and a fixed incidence angle of 40째. The parameters to be optimized include the thickness (30 to 250 nm) and refractive index (1.1 to 3) of the test layer. This relatively straightforward problem models a practical scenario where photonics researchers fine-tune a small number of parameters to achieve a desired spectral fit. This problem has small parameter space with fewer variables (thickness and refractive index), and the cost function is smooth and relatively free of noise, making it amenable to local optimization methods. Here are suggestions for designing algorithms: 1. Use local optimization algorithms like BFGS or Nelder-Mead, as they perform well in low-dimensional, smooth landscapes. 2. Uniform sampling across the parameter space ensures sufficient coverage for initial guesses. 3. Utilize fast convergence algorithms that can quickly exploit the smooth cost function landscape. 4.

Your task is to design novel metaheuristic algorithms to solve black box optimization problems.\nThe optimization algorithm should be able to find high-performing solutions to a wide range of tasks, which include evaluation on real-world applications such as, e.g., optimization of multilayered photonic structures. The ellipsometry problem involves retrieving the material and thickness of a reference layer by matching its reflectance properties using a known spectral response.
