The photovoltaics problem optimizes the design of an antireflective multilayer coating to maximize the absorption in the active silicon layer of a solar cell.

This problem is a challenging high-dimensional optimization problem with noisy cost functions due to the realistic solar spectrum, and it requires maximizing absorption while addressing trade-offs between reflectance and interference effects.

This problem is a challenging high-dimensional optimization problem with noisy cost functions due to the realistic solar spectrum, and it requires maximizing absorption while addressing trade-offs between reflectance and interference effects.

Encourage algorithms to detect and preserve modular structures (e.g., layers with specific roles like anti-reflective or coupling layers). 4. Gradually increase the number of layers during optimization to balance problem complexity and computational cost. 5. Integrate robustness metrics into the cost function to ensure the optimized design tolerates small perturbations in layer parameters. Your task is to write the optimization algorithm in Python code.

This problem is a challenging high-dimensional optimization problem with noisy cost functions due to the realistic solar spectrum, and it requires maximizing absorption while addressing trade-offs between reflectance and interference effects.

Your task is to design novel metaheuristic algorithms to solve black box optimization problems.\nThe optimization algorithm should be able to find high-performing solutions to a wide range of tasks, which include evaluation on real-world applications such as, e.g., optimization of multilayered photonic structures. The photovoltaics problem optimizes the design of an antireflective multilayer coating to maximize the absorption in the active silicon layer of a solar cell. The goal is to achieve maximum short-circuit current in the 375 to 750 nm wavelength range.

The optimization challenges include balancing high absorption with a low reflectance while addressing the inherent noise and irregularities in the solar spectrum. This problem is a challenging high-dimensional optimization problem with noisy cost functions due to the realistic solar spectrum, and it requires maximizing absorption while addressing trade-offs between reflectance and interference effects.

Use consistent benchmarking and convergence analysis to allocate computational resources effectively. 3. Encourage algorithms to detect and preserve modular structures (e.g., layers with specific roles like anti-reflective or coupling layers). 4. Gradually increase the number of layers during optimization to balance problem complexity and computational cost. 5. Integrate robustness metrics into the cost function to ensure the optimized design tolerates small perturbations in layer parameters. Your task is to write the optimization algorithm in Python code.

Your task is to design novel metaheuristic algorithms to solve black box optimization problems.\nThe optimization algorithm should be able to find high-performing solutions to a wide range of tasks, which include evaluation on real-world applications such as, e.g., optimization of multilayered photonic structures. The photovoltaics problem optimizes the design of an antireflective multilayer coating to maximize the absorption in the active silicon layer of a solar cell.

This problem is a challenging high-dimensional optimization problem with noisy cost functions due to the realistic solar spectrum, and it requires maximizing absorption while addressing trade-offs between reflectance and interference effects.

Your task is to design novel metaheuristic algorithms to solve black box optimization problems.\nThe optimization algorithm should be able to find high-performing solutions to a wide range of tasks, which include evaluation on real-world applications such as, e.g., optimization of multilayered photonic structures. The photovoltaics problem optimizes the design of an antireflective multilayer coating to maximize the absorption in the active silicon layer of a solar cell. The goal is to achieve maximum short-circuit current in the 375 to 750 nm wavelength range. The structure consists of alternating materials with permittivities of 2 and 3, built upon a 30,000 nm thick silicon substrate. Three subcases with increasing complexity are explored, involving 10 layers (photovoltaics), 20 layers (bigphotovoltaics), and 32 layers (hugephotovoltaics). The optimization challenges include balancing high absorption with a low reflectance while addressing the inherent noise and irregularities in the solar spectrum. This problem is a challenging high-dimensional optimization problem with noisy cost functions due to the realistic solar spectrum, and it requires maximizing absorption while addressing trade-offs between reflectance and interference effects. Here are the suggestions for designing algorithms: 1. Combine global methods (e.g., DE, CMA-ES) for exploration with local optimization for refinement. 2. Use consistent benchmarking and convergence analysis to allocate computational resources effectively. 3. Encourage algorithms to detect and preserve modular structures (e.g., layers with specific roles like anti-reflective or coupling layers). 4. Gradually increase the number of layers during optimization to balance problem complexity and computational cost. 5. Integrate robustness metrics into the cost function to ensure the optimized design tolerates small perturbations in layer parameters. Your task is to write the optimization algorithm in Python code.

Your task is to design novel metaheuristic algorithms to solve black box optimization problems.\nThe optimization algorithm should be able to find high-performing solutions to a wide range of tasks, which include evaluation on real-world applications such as, e.g., optimization of multilayered photonic structures. The photovoltaics problem optimizes the design of an antireflective multilayer coating to maximize the absorption in the active silicon layer of a solar cell.

This problem is a challenging high-dimensional optimization problem with noisy cost functions due to the realistic solar spectrum, and it requires maximizing absorption while addressing trade-offs between reflectance and interference effects.

Your task is to design novel metaheuristic algorithms to solve black box optimization problems.\nThe optimization algorithm should be able to find high-performing solutions to a wide range of tasks, which include evaluation on real-world applications such as, e.g., optimization of multilayered photonic structures. The photovoltaics problem optimizes the design of an antireflective multilayer coating to maximize the absorption in the active silicon layer of a solar cell. The goal is to achieve maximum short-circuit current in the 375 to 750 nm wavelength range. The structure consists of alternating materials with permittivities of 2 and 3, built upon a 30,000 nm thick silicon substrate. Three subcases with increasing complexity are explored, involving 10 layers (photovoltaics), 20 layers (bigphotovoltaics), and 32 layers (hugephotovoltaics). The optimization challenges include balancing high absorption with a low reflectance while addressing the inherent noise and irregularities in the solar spectrum. This problem is a challenging high-dimensional optimization problem with noisy cost functions due to the realistic solar spectrum, and it requires maximizing absorption while addressing trade-offs between reflectance and interference effects. Here are the suggestions for designing algorithms: 1. Combine global methods (e.g., DE, CMA-ES) for exploration with local optimization for refinement. 2. Use consistent benchmarking and convergence analysis to allocate computational resources effectively. 3. Encourage algorithms to detect and preserve modular structures (e.g., layers with specific roles like anti-reflective or coupling layers). 4. Gradually increase the number of layers during optimization to balance problem complexity and computational cost. 5. Integrate robustness metrics into the cost function to ensure the optimized design tolerates small perturbations in layer parameters. Your task is to write the optimization algorithm in Python code.

Your task is to design novel metaheuristic algorithms to solve black box optimization problems.\nThe optimization algorithm should be able to find high-performing solutions to a wide range of tasks, which include evaluation on real-world applications such as, e.g., optimization of multilayered photonic structures. The photovoltaics problem optimizes the design of an antireflective multilayer coating to maximize the absorption in the active silicon layer of a solar cell. The goal is to achieve maximum short-circuit current in the 375 to 750 nm wavelength range.

The optimization challenges include balancing high absorption with a low reflectance while addressing the inherent noise and irregularities in the solar spectrum. This problem is a challenging high-dimensional optimization problem with noisy cost functions due to the realistic solar spectrum, and it requires maximizing absorption while addressing trade-offs between reflectance and interference effects. Here are the suggestions for designing algorithms: 1. Combine global methods (e.g., DE, CMA-ES) for exploration with local optimization for refinement. 2. Use consistent benchmarking and convergence analysis to allocate computational resources effectively. 3. Encourage algorithms to detect and preserve modular structures (e.g., layers with specific roles like anti-reflective or coupling layers). 4. Gradually increase the number of layers during optimization to balance problem complexity and computational cost. 5. Integrate robustness metrics into the cost function to ensure the optimized design tolerates small perturbations in layer parameters. Your task is to write the optimization algorithm in Python code.

Your task is to design novel metaheuristic algorithms to solve black box optimization problems.\nThe optimization algorithm should be able to find high-performing solutions to a wide range of tasks, which include evaluation on real-world applications such as, e.g., optimization of multilayered photonic structures. The photovoltaics problem optimizes the design of an antireflective multilayer coating to maximize the absorption in the active silicon layer of a solar cell.

Your task is to design novel metaheuristic algorithms to solve black box optimization problems.\nThe optimization algorithm should be able to find high-performing solutions to a wide range of tasks, which include evaluation on real-world applications such as, e.g., optimization of multilayered photonic structures. The photovoltaics problem optimizes the design of an antireflective multilayer coating to maximize the absorption in the active silicon layer of a solar cell.

Your task is to design novel metaheuristic algorithms to solve black box optimization problems.\nThe optimization algorithm should be able to find high-performing solutions to a wide range of tasks, which include evaluation on real-world applications such as, e.g., optimization of multilayered photonic structures. The photovoltaics problem optimizes the design of an antireflective multilayer coating to maximize the absorption in the active silicon layer of a solar cell. The goal is to achieve maximum short-circuit current in the 375 to 750 nm wavelength range.

The optimization challenges include balancing high absorption with a low reflectance while addressing the inherent noise and irregularities in the solar spectrum. This problem is a challenging high-dimensional optimization problem with noisy cost functions due to the realistic solar spectrum, and it requires maximizing absorption while addressing trade-offs between reflectance and interference effects.

Use consistent benchmarking and convergence analysis to allocate computational resources effectively. 3. Encourage algorithms to detect and preserve modular structures (e.g., layers with specific roles like anti-reflective or coupling layers). 4. Gradually increase the number of layers during optimization to balance problem complexity and computational cost. 5. Integrate robustness metrics into the cost function to ensure the optimized design tolerates small perturbations in layer parameters. Your task is to write the optimization algorithm in Python code.

Your task is to design novel metaheuristic algorithms to solve black box optimization problems.\nThe optimization algorithm should be able to find high-performing solutions to a wide range of tasks, which include evaluation on real-world applications such as, e.g., optimization of multilayered photonic structures. The photovoltaics problem optimizes the design of an antireflective multilayer coating to maximize the absorption in the active silicon layer of a solar cell.

The optimization challenges include balancing high absorption with a low reflectance while addressing the inherent noise and irregularities in the solar spectrum. This problem is a challenging high-dimensional optimization problem with noisy cost functions due to the realistic solar spectrum, and it requires maximizing absorption while addressing trade-offs between reflectance and interference effects.

Use consistent benchmarking and convergence analysis to allocate computational resources effectively. 3. Encourage algorithms to detect and preserve modular structures (e.g., layers with specific roles like anti-reflective or coupling layers). 4. Gradually increase the number of layers during optimization to balance problem complexity and computational cost. 5. Integrate robustness metrics into the cost function to ensure the optimized design tolerates small perturbations in layer parameters. Your task is to write the optimization algorithm in Python code.

Your task is to design novel metaheuristic algorithms to solve black box optimization problems.\nThe optimization algorithm should be able to find high-performing solutions to a wide range of tasks, which include evaluation on real-world applications such as, e.g., optimization of multilayered photonic structures. The photovoltaics problem optimizes the design of an antireflective multilayer coating to maximize the absorption in the active silicon layer of a solar cell. The goal is to achieve maximum short-circuit current in the 375 to 750 nm wavelength range.

The optimization challenges include balancing high absorption with a low reflectance while addressing the inherent noise and irregularities in the solar spectrum. This problem is a challenging high-dimensional optimization problem with noisy cost functions due to the realistic solar spectrum, and it requires maximizing absorption while addressing trade-offs between reflectance and interference effects. Here are the suggestions for designing algorithms: 1. Combine global methods (e.g., DE, CMA-ES) for exploration with local optimization for refinement. 2. Use consistent benchmarking and convergence analysis to allocate computational resources effectively. 3. Encourage algorithms to detect and preserve modular structures (e.g., layers with specific roles like anti-reflective or coupling layers). 4. Gradually increase the number of layers during optimization to balance problem complexity and computational cost. 5. Integrate robustness metrics into the cost function to ensure the optimized design tolerates small perturbations in layer parameters. Your task is to write the optimization algorithm in Python code.

Your task is to design novel metaheuristic algorithms to solve black box optimization problems.\nThe optimization algorithm should be able to find high-performing solutions to a wide range of tasks, which include evaluation on real-world applications such as, e.g., optimization of multilayered photonic structures. The photovoltaics problem optimizes the design of an antireflective multilayer coating to maximize the absorption in the active silicon layer of a solar cell. The goal is to achieve maximum short-circuit current in the 375 to 750 nm wavelength range. The structure consists of alternating materials with permittivities of 2 and 3, built upon a 30,000 nm thick silicon substrate. Three subcases with increasing complexity are explored, involving 10 layers (photovoltaics), 20 layers (bigphotovoltaics), and 32 layers (hugephotovoltaics). The optimization challenges include balancing high absorption with a low reflectance while addressing the inherent noise and irregularities in the solar spectrum. This problem is a challenging high-dimensional optimization problem with noisy cost functions due to the realistic solar spectrum, and it requires maximizing absorption while addressing trade-offs between reflectance and interference effects. Here are the suggestions for designing algorithms: 1. Combine global methods (e.g., DE, CMA-ES) for exploration with local optimization for refinement. 2. Use consistent benchmarking and convergence analysis to allocate computational resources effectively. 3. Encourage algorithms to detect and preserve modular structures (e.g., layers with specific roles like anti-reflective or coupling layers). 4. Gradually increase the number of layers during optimization to balance problem complexity and computational cost. 5. Integrate robustness metrics into the cost function to ensure the optimized design tolerates small perturbations in layer parameters. Your task is to write the optimization algorithm in Python code.

Your task is to design novel metaheuristic algorithms to solve black box optimization problems.\nThe optimization algorithm should be able to find high-performing solutions to a wide range of tasks, which include evaluation on real-world applications such as, e.g., optimization of multilayered photonic structures. The photovoltaics problem optimizes the design of an antireflective multilayer coating to maximize the absorption in the active silicon layer of a solar cell.

Your task is to design novel metaheuristic algorithms to solve black box optimization problems.\nThe optimization algorithm should be able to find high-performing solutions to a wide range of tasks, which include evaluation on real-world applications such as, e.g., optimization of multilayered photonic structures. The photovoltaics problem optimizes the design of an antireflective multilayer coating to maximize the absorption in the active silicon layer of a solar cell.

This problem is a challenging high-dimensional optimization problem with noisy cost functions due to the realistic solar spectrum, and it requires maximizing absorption while addressing trade-offs between reflectance and interference effects.

Encourage algorithms to detect and preserve modular structures (e.g., layers with specific roles like anti-reflective or coupling layers). 4. Gradually increase the number of layers during optimization to balance problem complexity and computational cost. 5. Integrate robustness metrics into the cost function to ensure the optimized design tolerates small perturbations in layer parameters. Your task is to write the optimization algorithm in Python code.

Your task is to design novel metaheuristic algorithms to solve black box optimization problems.\nThe optimization algorithm should be able to find high-performing solutions to a wide range of tasks, which include evaluation on real-world applications such as, e.g., optimization of multilayered photonic structures. The photovoltaics problem optimizes the design of an antireflective multilayer coating to maximize the absorption in the active silicon layer of a solar cell. The goal is to achieve maximum short-circuit current in the 375 to 750 nm wavelength range.

The optimization challenges include balancing high absorption with a low reflectance while addressing the inherent noise and irregularities in the solar spectrum. This problem is a challenging high-dimensional optimization problem with noisy cost functions due to the realistic solar spectrum, and it requires maximizing absorption while addressing trade-offs between reflectance and interference effects. Here are the suggestions for designing algorithms: 1. Combine global methods (e.g., DE, CMA-ES) for exploration with local optimization for refinement. 2. Use consistent benchmarking and convergence analysis to allocate computational resources effectively. 3. Encourage algorithms to detect and preserve modular structures (e.g., layers with specific roles like anti-reflective or coupling layers). 4. Gradually increase the number of layers during optimization to balance problem complexity and computational cost. 5. Integrate robustness metrics into the cost function to ensure the optimized design tolerates small perturbations in layer parameters. Your task is to write the optimization algorithm in Python code.

Your task is to design novel metaheuristic algorithms to solve black box optimization problems.\nThe optimization algorithm should be able to find high-performing solutions to a wide range of tasks, which include evaluation on real-world applications such as, e.g., optimization of multilayered photonic structures. The photovoltaics problem optimizes the design of an antireflective multilayer coating to maximize the absorption in the active silicon layer of a solar cell. The goal is to achieve maximum short-circuit current in the 375 to 750 nm wavelength range.

The optimization challenges include balancing high absorption with a low reflectance while addressing the inherent noise and irregularities in the solar spectrum. This problem is a challenging high-dimensional optimization problem with noisy cost functions due to the realistic solar spectrum, and it requires maximizing absorption while addressing trade-offs between reflectance and interference effects.

Encourage algorithms to detect and preserve modular structures (e.g., layers with specific roles like anti-reflective or coupling layers). 4. Gradually increase the number of layers during optimization to balance problem complexity and computational cost. 5. Integrate robustness metrics into the cost function to ensure the optimized design tolerates small perturbations in layer parameters. Your task is to write the optimization algorithm in Python code.

Your task is to design novel metaheuristic algorithms to solve black box optimization problems.\nThe optimization algorithm should be able to find high-performing solutions to a wide range of tasks, which include evaluation on real-world applications such as, e.g., optimization of multilayered photonic structures. The photovoltaics problem optimizes the design of an antireflective multilayer coating to maximize the absorption in the active silicon layer of a solar cell. The goal is to achieve maximum short-circuit current in the 375 to 750 nm wavelength range.

The optimization challenges include balancing high absorption with a low reflectance while addressing the inherent noise and irregularities in the solar spectrum. This problem is a challenging high-dimensional optimization problem with noisy cost functions due to the realistic solar spectrum, and it requires maximizing absorption while addressing trade-offs between reflectance and interference effects.

Use consistent benchmarking and convergence analysis to allocate computational resources effectively. 3. Encourage algorithms to detect and preserve modular structures (e.g., layers with specific roles like anti-reflective or coupling layers). 4. Gradually increase the number of layers during optimization to balance problem complexity and computational cost. 5. Integrate robustness metrics into the cost function to ensure the optimized design tolerates small perturbations in layer parameters. Your task is to write the optimization algorithm in Python code.

Your task is to design novel metaheuristic algorithms to solve black box optimization problems.\nThe optimization algorithm should be able to find high-performing solutions to a wide range of tasks, which include evaluation on real-world applications such as, e.g., optimization of multilayered photonic structures. The photovoltaics problem optimizes the design of an antireflective multilayer coating to maximize the absorption in the active silicon layer of a solar cell.

Your task is to design novel metaheuristic algorithms to solve black box optimization problems.\nThe optimization algorithm should be able to find high-performing solutions to a wide range of tasks, which include evaluation on real-world applications such as, e.g., optimization of multilayered photonic structures. The photovoltaics problem optimizes the design of an antireflective multilayer coating to maximize the absorption in the active silicon layer of a solar cell.

Your task is to design novel metaheuristic algorithms to solve black box optimization problems.\nThe optimization algorithm should be able to find high-performing solutions to a wide range of tasks, which include evaluation on real-world applications such as, e.g., optimization of multilayered photonic structures. The photovoltaics problem optimizes the design of an antireflective multilayer coating to maximize the absorption in the active silicon layer of a solar cell. The goal is to achieve maximum short-circuit current in the 375 to 750 nm wavelength range.

The optimization challenges include balancing high absorption with a low reflectance while addressing the inherent noise and irregularities in the solar spectrum. This problem is a challenging high-dimensional optimization problem with noisy cost functions due to the realistic solar spectrum, and it requires maximizing absorption while addressing trade-offs between reflectance and interference effects. Here are the suggestions for designing algorithms: 1. Combine global methods (e.g., DE, CMA-ES) for exploration with local optimization for refinement. 2. Use consistent benchmarking and convergence analysis to allocate computational resources effectively. 3. Encourage algorithms to detect and preserve modular structures (e.g., layers with specific roles like anti-reflective or coupling layers). 4. Gradually increase the number of layers during optimization to balance problem complexity and computational cost. 5. Integrate robustness metrics into the cost function to ensure the optimized design tolerates small perturbations in layer parameters. Your task is to write the optimization algorithm in Python code.

Your task is to design novel metaheuristic algorithms to solve black box optimization problems.\nThe optimization algorithm should be able to find high-performing solutions to a wide range of tasks, which include evaluation on real-world applications such as, e.g., optimization of multilayered photonic structures. The photovoltaics problem optimizes the design of an antireflective multilayer coating to maximize the absorption in the active silicon layer of a solar cell.

This problem is a challenging high-dimensional optimization problem with noisy cost functions due to the realistic solar spectrum, and it requires maximizing absorption while addressing trade-offs between reflectance and interference effects.

Your task is to design novel metaheuristic algorithms to solve black box optimization problems.\nThe optimization algorithm should be able to find high-performing solutions to a wide range of tasks, which include evaluation on real-world applications such as, e.g., optimization of multilayered photonic structures. The photovoltaics problem optimizes the design of an antireflective multilayer coating to maximize the absorption in the active silicon layer of a solar cell.

The optimization challenges include balancing high absorption with a low reflectance while addressing the inherent noise and irregularities in the solar spectrum. This problem is a challenging high-dimensional optimization problem with noisy cost functions due to the realistic solar spectrum, and it requires maximizing absorption while addressing trade-offs between reflectance and interference effects.

Use consistent benchmarking and convergence analysis to allocate computational resources effectively. 3. Encourage algorithms to detect and preserve modular structures (e.g., layers with specific roles like anti-reflective or coupling layers). 4. Gradually increase the number of layers during optimization to balance problem complexity and computational cost. 5. Integrate robustness metrics into the cost function to ensure the optimized design tolerates small perturbations in layer parameters. Your task is to write the optimization algorithm in Python code.

Your task is to design novel metaheuristic algorithms to solve black box optimization problems.\nThe optimization algorithm should be able to find high-performing solutions to a wide range of tasks, which include evaluation on real-world applications such as, e.g., optimization of multilayered photonic structures. The photovoltaics problem optimizes the design of an antireflective multilayer coating to maximize the absorption in the active silicon layer of a solar cell.

Your task is to design novel metaheuristic algorithms to solve black box optimization problems.\nThe optimization algorithm should be able to find high-performing solutions to a wide range of tasks, which include evaluation on real-world applications such as, e.g., optimization of multilayered photonic structures. The photovoltaics problem optimizes the design of an antireflective multilayer coating to maximize the absorption in the active silicon layer of a solar cell.

Your task is to design novel metaheuristic algorithms to solve black box optimization problems.\nThe optimization algorithm should be able to find high-performing solutions to a wide range of tasks, which include evaluation on real-world applications such as, e.g., optimization of multilayered photonic structures. The photovoltaics problem optimizes the design of an antireflective multilayer coating to maximize the absorption in the active silicon layer of a solar cell.

Your task is to design novel metaheuristic algorithms to solve black box optimization problems.\nThe optimization algorithm should be able to find high-performing solutions to a wide range of tasks, which include evaluation on real-world applications such as, e.g., optimization of multilayered photonic structures. The photovoltaics problem optimizes the design of an antireflective multilayer coating to maximize the absorption in the active silicon layer of a solar cell. The goal is to achieve maximum short-circuit current in the 375 to 750 nm wavelength range.

The optimization challenges include balancing high absorption with a low reflectance while addressing the inherent noise and irregularities in the solar spectrum. This problem is a challenging high-dimensional optimization problem with noisy cost functions due to the realistic solar spectrum, and it requires maximizing absorption while addressing trade-offs between reflectance and interference effects.

Use consistent benchmarking and convergence analysis to allocate computational resources effectively. 3. Encourage algorithms to detect and preserve modular structures (e.g., layers with specific roles like anti-reflective or coupling layers). 4. Gradually increase the number of layers during optimization to balance problem complexity and computational cost. 5. Integrate robustness metrics into the cost function to ensure the optimized design tolerates small perturbations in layer parameters. Your task is to write the optimization algorithm in Python code.

Your task is to design novel metaheuristic algorithms to solve black box optimization problems.\nThe optimization algorithm should be able to find high-performing solutions to a wide range of tasks, which include evaluation on real-world applications such as, e.g., optimization of multilayered photonic structures. The photovoltaics problem optimizes the design of an antireflective multilayer coating to maximize the absorption in the active silicon layer of a solar cell. The goal is to achieve maximum short-circuit current in the 375 to 750 nm wavelength range.

The optimization challenges include balancing high absorption with a low reflectance while addressing the inherent noise and irregularities in the solar spectrum. This problem is a challenging high-dimensional optimization problem with noisy cost functions due to the realistic solar spectrum, and it requires maximizing absorption while addressing trade-offs between reflectance and interference effects.

Use consistent benchmarking and convergence analysis to allocate computational resources effectively. 3. Encourage algorithms to detect and preserve modular structures (e.g., layers with specific roles like anti-reflective or coupling layers). 4. Gradually increase the number of layers during optimization to balance problem complexity and computational cost. 5. Integrate robustness metrics into the cost function to ensure the optimized design tolerates small perturbations in layer parameters. Your task is to write the optimization algorithm in Python code.

{"role": "LLaMEA", "time": "2025-03-13 22:44:45.366111", "content": "You are a highly skilled computer scientist in the field of natural computing. Your task is to design novel metaheuristic algorithms to solve black box optimization problems.\nThe optimization algorithm should be able to find high-performing solutions to a wide range of tasks, which include evaluation on real-world applications such as, e.g., optimization of multilayered photonic structures. The photovoltaics problem optimizes the design of an antireflective multilayer coating to maximize the absorption in the active silicon layer of a solar cell. The goal is to achieve maximum short-circuit current in the 375 to 750 nm wavelength range. The structure consists of alternating materials with permittivities of 2 and 3, built upon a 30,000 nm thick silicon substrate. Three subcases with increasing complexity are explored, involving 10 layers (photovoltaics), 20 layers (bigphotovoltaics), and 32 layers (hugephotovoltaics). The optimization challenges include balancing high absorption with a low reflectance while addressing the inherent noise and irregularities in the solar spectrum. This problem is a challenging high-dimensional optimization problem with noisy cost functions due to the realistic solar spectrum, and it requires maximizing absorption while addressing trade-offs between reflectance and interference effects. Here are the suggestions for designing algorithms: 1. Combine global methods (e.g., DE, CMA-ES) for exploration with local optimization for refinement. 2. Use consistent benchmarking and convergence analysis to allocate computational resources effectively. 3. Encourage algorithms to detect and preserve modular structures (e.g., layers with specific roles like anti-reflective or coupling layers). 4. Gradually increase the number of layers during optimization to balance problem complexity and computational cost. 5. Integrate robustness metrics into the cost function to ensure the optimized design tolerates small perturbations in layer parameters. Your task is to write the optimization algorithm in Python code. The code should contain an `__init__(self, budget, dim)` function and the function `def __call__(self, func)`, which should optimize the black box function `func` using `self.budget` function evaluations.\nThe func() can only be called as many times as the budget allows, not more.
