Your task is to design novel metaheuristic algorithms to solve black box optimization problems.\n    The optimization algorithm should be able to find high-performing solutions to a wide range of tasks, which include evaluation on real-world applications such as, e.g., optimization of multilayered photonic structures. The Bragg mirror optimization aims to maximize reflectivity at a wavelength of 600 nm using a multilayer structure with alternating refractive indices (1.4 and 1.8). The structure's thicknesses are varied to find the configuration with the highest reflectivity. The problem involves two cases: one with 10 layers (minibragg) and another with 20 layers (bragg), with the latter representing a more complex inverse design problem. The known optimal solution is a periodic Bragg mirror, which achieves the best reflectivity by leveraging constructive interference. This case exemplifies challenges such as multiple local minima in the optimization landscape. For this problem, the optimization landscape contains multiple local minima due to the wave nature of the problem. And periodic solutions are known to provide near-optimal results, suggesting the importance of leveraging constructive interference principles. Here are some suggestions for designing algorithms: 1.

Your task is to design novel metaheuristic algorithms to solve black box optimization problems.\n    The optimization algorithm should be able to find high-performing solutions to a wide range of tasks, which include evaluation on real-world applications such as, e.g., optimization of multilayered photonic structures. The Bragg mirror optimization aims to maximize reflectivity at a wavelength of 600 nm using a multilayer structure with alternating refractive indices (1.4 and 1.8). The structure's thicknesses are varied to find the configuration with the highest reflectivity. The problem involves two cases: one with 10 layers (minibragg) and another with 20 layers (bragg), with the latter representing a more complex inverse design problem. The known optimal solution is a periodic Bragg mirror, which achieves the best reflectivity by leveraging constructive interference. This case exemplifies challenges such as multiple local minima in the optimization landscape. For this problem, the optimization landscape contains multiple local minima due to the wave nature of the problem. And periodic solutions are known to provide near-optimal results, suggesting the importance of leveraging constructive interference principles. Here are some suggestions for designing algorithms: 1. Use global optimization algorithms like Differential Evolution (DE) or Genetic Algorithms (GA) to explore the parameter space broadly. 2. Symmetric initialization strategies (e.g., Quasi-Oppositional DE) can improve exploration by evenly sampling the search space. 3. Algorithms should preserve modular characteristics in solutions, as multilayer designs often benefit from distinct functional blocks. 4. Combine global methods with local optimization (e.g., BFGS) to fine-tune solutions near promising regions. 5. Encourage periodicity in solutions via tailored cost functions or constraints. Your task is to write the optimization algorithm in Python code. The code should contain an `__init__(self, budget, dim)` function and the function `def __call__(self, func)`, which should optimize the black box function `func` using `self.budget` function evaluations.\n    The func() can only be called as many times as the budget allows, not more.

{"role": "LLaMEA", "time": "2025-03-18 01:59:00.139886", "content": "You are a highly skilled computer scientist in the field of natural computing. Your task is to design novel metaheuristic algorithms to solve black box optimization problems.\n    The optimization algorithm should be able to find high-performing solutions to a wide range of tasks, which include evaluation on real-world applications such as, e.g., optimization of multilayered photonic structures. The Bragg mirror optimization aims to maximize reflectivity at a wavelength of 600 nm using a multilayer structure with alternating refractive indices (1.4 and 1.8). The structure's thicknesses are varied to find the configuration with the highest reflectivity. The problem involves two cases: one with 10 layers (minibragg) and another with 20 layers (bragg), with the latter representing a more complex inverse design problem. The known optimal solution is a periodic Bragg mirror, which achieves the best reflectivity by leveraging constructive interference. This case exemplifies challenges such as multiple local minima in the optimization landscape. For this problem, the optimization landscape contains multiple local minima due to the wave nature of the problem. And periodic solutions are known to provide near-optimal results, suggesting the importance of leveraging constructive interference principles. Here are some suggestions for designing algorithms: 1. Use global optimization algorithms like Differential Evolution (DE) or Genetic Algorithms (GA) to explore the parameter space broadly. 2. Symmetric initialization strategies (e.g., Quasi-Oppositional DE) can improve exploration by evenly sampling the search space. 3. Algorithms should preserve modular characteristics in solutions, as multilayer designs often benefit from distinct functional blocks. 4. Combine global methods with local optimization (e.g., BFGS) to fine-tune solutions near promising regions. 5. Encourage periodicity in solutions via tailored cost functions or constraints. Your task is to write the optimization algorithm in Python code. The code should contain an `__init__(self, budget, dim)` function and the function `def __call__(self, func)`, which should optimize the black box function `func` using `self.budget` function evaluations.\n    The func() can only be called as many times as the budget allows, not more. Each of the optimization functions has a search space between func.bounds.lb (lower bound) and func.bounds.ub (upper bound).

Your task is to design novel metaheuristic algorithms to solve black box optimization problems.\n    The optimization algorithm should be able to find high-performing solutions to a wide range of tasks, which include evaluation on real-world applications such as, e.g., optimization of multilayered photonic structures. The Bragg mirror optimization aims to maximize reflectivity at a wavelength of 600 nm using a multilayer structure with alternating refractive indices (1.4 and 1.8). The structure's thicknesses are varied to find the configuration with the highest reflectivity. The problem involves two cases: one with 10 layers (minibragg) and another with 20 layers (bragg), with the latter representing a more complex inverse design problem. The known optimal solution is a periodic Bragg mirror, which achieves the best reflectivity by leveraging constructive interference. This case exemplifies challenges such as multiple local minima in the optimization landscape. For this problem, the optimization landscape contains multiple local minima due to the wave nature of the problem. And periodic solutions are known to provide near-optimal results, suggesting the importance of leveraging constructive interference principles. Here are some suggestions for designing algorithms: 1. Use global optimization algorithms like Differential Evolution (DE) or Genetic Algorithms (GA) to explore the parameter space broadly. 2. Symmetric initialization strategies (e.g., Quasi-Oppositional DE) can improve exploration by evenly sampling the search space. 3. Algorithms should preserve modular characteristics in solutions, as multilayer designs often benefit from distinct functional blocks. 4.

Make sure you only change 6.3% of the code, which means if the code has 100 lines, you can only change 6.349206349206349 lines, and the rest of the lines should remain unchanged. This input code has 63 lines, so you can only change 4 lines, the rest 59 lines should remain unchanged. This changing rate 6.3% is the mandatory requirement, you cannot change more or less than this rate.\n\n\nProvide the Python code and a one-line description with the main idea (without enters).

Your task is to design novel metaheuristic algorithms to solve black box optimization problems.\n    The optimization algorithm should be able to find high-performing solutions to a wide range of tasks, which include evaluation on real-world applications such as, e.g., optimization of multilayered photonic structures. The Bragg mirror optimization aims to maximize reflectivity at a wavelength of 600 nm using a multilayer structure with alternating refractive indices (1.4 and 1.8). The structure's thicknesses are varied to find the configuration with the highest reflectivity. The problem involves two cases: one with 10 layers (minibragg) and another with 20 layers (bragg), with the latter representing a more complex inverse design problem.

Make sure you only change 4.8% of the code, which means if the code has 100 lines, you can only change 4.838709677419355 lines, and the rest of the lines should remain unchanged. This input code has 62 lines, so you can only change 3 lines, the rest 59 lines should remain unchanged.

Your task is to design novel metaheuristic algorithms to solve black box optimization problems.\n    The optimization algorithm should be able to find high-performing solutions to a wide range of tasks, which include evaluation on real-world applications such as, e.g., optimization of multilayered photonic structures. The Bragg mirror optimization aims to maximize reflectivity at a wavelength of 600 nm using a multilayer structure with alternating refractive indices (1.4 and 1.8). The structure's thicknesses are varied to find the configuration with the highest reflectivity. The problem involves two cases: one with 10 layers (minibragg) and another with 20 layers (bragg), with the latter representing a more complex inverse design problem. The known optimal solution is a periodic Bragg mirror, which achieves the best reflectivity by leveraging constructive interference. This case exemplifies challenges such as multiple local minima in the optimization landscape. For this problem, the optimization landscape contains multiple local minima due to the wave nature of the problem. And periodic solutions are known to provide near-optimal results, suggesting the importance of leveraging constructive interference principles. Here are some suggestions for designing algorithms: 1. Use global optimization algorithms like Differential Evolution (DE) or Genetic Algorithms (GA) to explore the parameter space broadly. 2. Symmetric initialization strategies (e.g., Quasi-Oppositional DE) can improve exploration by evenly sampling the search space. 3.

Your task is to design novel metaheuristic algorithms to solve black box optimization problems.\n    The optimization algorithm should be able to find high-performing solutions to a wide range of tasks, which include evaluation on real-world applications such as, e.g., optimization of multilayered photonic structures. The Bragg mirror optimization aims to maximize reflectivity at a wavelength of 600 nm using a multilayer structure with alternating refractive indices (1.4 and 1.8). The structure's thicknesses are varied to find the configuration with the highest reflectivity. The problem involves two cases: one with 10 layers (minibragg) and another with 20 layers (bragg), with the latter representing a more complex inverse design problem. The known optimal solution is a periodic Bragg mirror, which achieves the best reflectivity by leveraging constructive interference. This case exemplifies challenges such as multiple local minima in the optimization landscape. For this problem, the optimization landscape contains multiple local minima due to the wave nature of the problem.

Your task is to design novel metaheuristic algorithms to solve black box optimization problems.\n    The optimization algorithm should be able to find high-performing solutions to a wide range of tasks, which include evaluation on real-world applications such as, e.g., optimization of multilayered photonic structures. The Bragg mirror optimization aims to maximize reflectivity at a wavelength of 600 nm using a multilayer structure with alternating refractive indices (1.4 and 1.8). The structure's thicknesses are varied to find the configuration with the highest reflectivity. The problem involves two cases: one with 10 layers (minibragg) and another with 20 layers (bragg), with the latter representing a more complex inverse design problem.

Your task is to design novel metaheuristic algorithms to solve black box optimization problems.\n    The optimization algorithm should be able to find high-performing solutions to a wide range of tasks, which include evaluation on real-world applications such as, e.g., optimization of multilayered photonic structures. The Bragg mirror optimization aims to maximize reflectivity at a wavelength of 600 nm using a multilayer structure with alternating refractive indices (1.4 and 1.8). The structure's thicknesses are varied to find the configuration with the highest reflectivity. The problem involves two cases: one with 10 layers (minibragg) and another with 20 layers (bragg), with the latter representing a more complex inverse design problem.

Your task is to design novel metaheuristic algorithms to solve black box optimization problems.\n    The optimization algorithm should be able to find high-performing solutions to a wide range of tasks, which include evaluation on real-world applications such as, e.g., optimization of multilayered photonic structures. The Bragg mirror optimization aims to maximize reflectivity at a wavelength of 600 nm using a multilayer structure with alternating refractive indices (1.4 and 1.8).

Your task is to design novel metaheuristic algorithms to solve black box optimization problems.\n    The optimization algorithm should be able to find high-performing solutions to a wide range of tasks, which include evaluation on real-world applications such as, e.g., optimization of multilayered photonic structures. The Bragg mirror optimization aims to maximize reflectivity at a wavelength of 600 nm using a multilayer structure with alternating refractive indices (1.4 and 1.8). The structure's thicknesses are varied to find the configuration with the highest reflectivity. The problem involves two cases: one with 10 layers (minibragg) and another with 20 layers (bragg), with the latter representing a more complex inverse design problem.

Your task is to design novel metaheuristic algorithms to solve black box optimization problems.\n    The optimization algorithm should be able to find high-performing solutions to a wide range of tasks, which include evaluation on real-world applications such as, e.g., optimization of multilayered photonic structures. The Bragg mirror optimization aims to maximize reflectivity at a wavelength of 600 nm using a multilayer structure with alternating refractive indices (1.4 and 1.8).

Make sure you only change 6.5% of the code, which means if the code has 100 lines, you can only change 6.451612903225806 lines, and the rest of the lines should remain unchanged. This input code has 62 lines, so you can only change 4 lines, the rest 58 lines should remain unchanged.

Your task is to design novel metaheuristic algorithms to solve black box optimization problems.\n    The optimization algorithm should be able to find high-performing solutions to a wide range of tasks, which include evaluation on real-world applications such as, e.g., optimization of multilayered photonic structures. The Bragg mirror optimization aims to maximize reflectivity at a wavelength of 600 nm using a multilayer structure with alternating refractive indices (1.4 and 1.8). The structure's thicknesses are varied to find the configuration with the highest reflectivity. The problem involves two cases: one with 10 layers (minibragg) and another with 20 layers (bragg), with the latter representing a more complex inverse design problem. The known optimal solution is a periodic Bragg mirror, which achieves the best reflectivity by leveraging constructive interference.

The Bragg mirror optimization aims to maximize reflectivity at a wavelength of 600 nm using a multilayer structure with alternating refractive indices (1.4 and 1.8).
