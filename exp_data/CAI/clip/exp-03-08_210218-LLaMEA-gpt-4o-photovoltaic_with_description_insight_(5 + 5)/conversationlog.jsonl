{"role": "LLaMEA", "time": "2025-03-09 01:25:42.378522", "content": "You are a highly skilled computer scientist in the field of natural computing. Your task is to design novel metaheuristic algorithms to solve black box optimization problems.\nThe optimization algorithm should be able to find high-performing solutions to a wide range of tasks, which include evaluation on real-world applications such as, e.g., optimization of multilayered photonic structures. The photovoltaics problem optimizes the design of an antireflective multilayer coating to maximize the absorption in the active silicon layer of a solar cell. The goal is to achieve maximum short-circuit current in the 375 to 750 nm wavelength range. The structure consists of alternating materials with permittivities of 2 and 3, built upon a 30,000 nm thick silicon substrate. Three subcases with increasing complexity are explored, involving 10 layers (photovoltaics), 20 layers (bigphotovoltaics), and 32 layers (hugephotovoltaics). The optimization challenges include balancing high absorption with a low reflectance while addressing the inherent noise and irregularities in the solar spectrum. This problem is a challenging high-dimensional optimization problem with noisy cost functions due to the realistic solar spectrum, and it requires maximizing absorption while addressing trade-offs between reflectance and interference effects. Here are the suggestions for designing algorithms: 1. Combine global methods (e.g., DE, CMA-ES) for exploration with local optimization for refinement. 2. Use consistent benchmarking and convergence analysis to allocate computational resources effectively. 3. Encourage algorithms to detect and preserve modular structures (e.g., layers with specific roles like anti-reflective or coupling layers). 4. Gradually increase the number of layers during optimization to balance problem complexity and computational cost. 5. Integrate robustness metrics into the cost function to ensure the optimized design tolerates small perturbations in layer parameters. Your task is to write the optimization algorithm in Python code. The code should contain an `__init__(self, budget, dim)` function and the function `def __call__(self, func)`, which should optimize the black box function `func` using `self.budget` function evaluations.\nThe func() can only be called as many times as the budget allows, not more. Each of the optimization functions has a search space between func.bounds.lb (lower bound) and func.bounds.ub (upper bound). The dimensionality can be varied.\nGive an excellent and novel heuristic algorithm to solve this task and include it's one-line description with the main idea of the algorithm.\n\nThe current population of algorithms already evaluated (name, description, score) is:\nHybridDELocalSearch: A hybrid differential evolution and local search metaheuristic that adapts layer complexity dynamically while maintaining robust design against noise.

Your task is to design novel metaheuristic algorithms to solve black box optimization problems.\nThe optimization algorithm should be able to find high-performing solutions to a wide range of tasks, which include evaluation on real-world applications such as, e.g., optimization of multilayered photonic structures. The photovoltaics problem optimizes the design of an antireflective multilayer coating to maximize the absorption in the active silicon layer of a solar cell. The goal is to achieve maximum short-circuit current in the 375 to 750 nm wavelength range. The structure consists of alternating materials with permittivities of 2 and 3, built upon a 30,000 nm thick silicon substrate. Three subcases with increasing complexity are explored, involving 10 layers (photovoltaics), 20 layers (bigphotovoltaics), and 32 layers (hugephotovoltaics). The optimization challenges include balancing high absorption with a low reflectance while addressing the inherent noise and irregularities in the solar spectrum. This problem is a challenging high-dimensional optimization problem with noisy cost functions due to the realistic solar spectrum, and it requires maximizing absorption while addressing trade-offs between reflectance and interference effects. Here are the suggestions for designing algorithms: 1. Combine global methods (e.g., DE, CMA-ES) for exploration with local optimization for refinement. 2. Use consistent benchmarking and convergence analysis to allocate computational resources effectively. 3. Encourage algorithms to detect and preserve modular structures (e.g., layers with specific roles like anti-reflective or coupling layers). 4. Gradually increase the number of layers during optimization to balance problem complexity and computational cost. 5. Integrate robustness metrics into the cost function to ensure the optimized design tolerates small perturbations in layer parameters. Your task is to write the optimization algorithm in Python code. The code should contain an `__init__(self, budget, dim)` function and the function `def __call__(self, func)`, which should optimize the black box function `func` using `self.budget` function evaluations.\nThe func() can only be called as many times as the budget allows, not more.

Your task is to design novel metaheuristic algorithms to solve black box optimization problems.\nThe optimization algorithm should be able to find high-performing solutions to a wide range of tasks, which include evaluation on real-world applications such as, e.g., optimization of multilayered photonic structures. The photovoltaics problem optimizes the design of an antireflective multilayer coating to maximize the absorption in the active silicon layer of a solar cell. The goal is to achieve maximum short-circuit current in the 375 to 750 nm wavelength range. The structure consists of alternating materials with permittivities of 2 and 3, built upon a 30,000 nm thick silicon substrate. Three subcases with increasing complexity are explored, involving 10 layers (photovoltaics), 20 layers (bigphotovoltaics), and 32 layers (hugephotovoltaics). The optimization challenges include balancing high absorption with a low reflectance while addressing the inherent noise and irregularities in the solar spectrum. This problem is a challenging high-dimensional optimization problem with noisy cost functions due to the realistic solar spectrum, and it requires maximizing absorption while addressing trade-offs between reflectance and interference effects. Here are the suggestions for designing algorithms: 1. Combine global methods (e.g., DE, CMA-ES) for exploration with local optimization for refinement. 2. Use consistent benchmarking and convergence analysis to allocate computational resources effectively. 3. Encourage algorithms to detect and preserve modular structures (e.g., layers with specific roles like anti-reflective or coupling layers). 4. Gradually increase the number of layers during optimization to balance problem complexity and computational cost. 5. Integrate robustness metrics into the cost function to ensure the optimized design tolerates small perturbations in layer parameters. Your task is to write the optimization algorithm in Python code. The code should contain an `__init__(self, budget, dim)` function and the function `def __call__(self, func)`, which should optimize the black box function `func` using `self.budget` function evaluations.\nThe func() can only be called as many times as the budget allows, not more. Each of the optimization functions has a search space between func.bounds.lb (lower bound) and func.bounds.ub (upper bound). The dimensionality can be varied.\nGive an excellent and novel heuristic algorithm to solve this task and include it's one-line description with the main idea of the algorithm.\n\nThe current population of algorithms already evaluated (name, description, score) is:\nHybridDELocalSearch: A hybrid differential evolution and local search metaheuristic that adapts layer complexity dynamically while maintaining robust design against noise.

{"role": "LLaMEA", "time": "2025-03-09 06:42:40.684973", "content": "You are a highly skilled computer scientist in the field of natural computing. Your task is to design novel metaheuristic algorithms to solve black box optimization problems.\nThe optimization algorithm should be able to find high-performing solutions to a wide range of tasks, which include evaluation on real-world applications such as, e.g., optimization of multilayered photonic structures. The photovoltaics problem optimizes the design of an antireflective multilayer coating to maximize the absorption in the active silicon layer of a solar cell. The goal is to achieve maximum short-circuit current in the 375 to 750 nm wavelength range. The structure consists of alternating materials with permittivities of 2 and 3, built upon a 30,000 nm thick silicon substrate. Three subcases with increasing complexity are explored, involving 10 layers (photovoltaics), 20 layers (bigphotovoltaics), and 32 layers (hugephotovoltaics). The optimization challenges include balancing high absorption with a low reflectance while addressing the inherent noise and irregularities in the solar spectrum. This problem is a challenging high-dimensional optimization problem with noisy cost functions due to the realistic solar spectrum, and it requires maximizing absorption while addressing trade-offs between reflectance and interference effects. Here are the suggestions for designing algorithms: 1. Combine global methods (e.g., DE, CMA-ES) for exploration with local optimization for refinement. 2. Use consistent benchmarking and convergence analysis to allocate computational resources effectively. 3. Encourage algorithms to detect and preserve modular structures (e.g., layers with specific roles like anti-reflective or coupling layers). 4. Gradually increase the number of layers during optimization to balance problem complexity and computational cost. 5. Integrate robustness metrics into the cost function to ensure the optimized design tolerates small perturbations in layer parameters. Your task is to write the optimization algorithm in Python code. The code should contain an `__init__(self, budget, dim)` function and the function `def __call__(self, func)`, which should optimize the black box function `func` using `self.budget` function evaluations.\nThe func() can only be called as many times as the budget allows, not more. Each of the optimization functions has a search space between func.bounds.lb (lower bound) and func.bounds.ub (upper bound). The dimensionality can be varied.\nGive an excellent and novel heuristic algorithm to solve this task and include it's one-line description with the main idea of the algorithm.\n\nThe current population of algorithms already evaluated (name, description, score) is:\nHybridMetaheuristic: A hybrid metaheuristic combining Differential Evolution for global exploration with Nelder-Mead for local refinement, now with an increased population size for enhanced diversity and exploration efficacy in high-dimensional noisy optimization.

Your task is to design novel metaheuristic algorithms to solve black box optimization problems.\nThe optimization algorithm should be able to find high-performing solutions to a wide range of tasks, which include evaluation on real-world applications such as, e.g., optimization of multilayered photonic structures. The photovoltaics problem optimizes the design of an antireflective multilayer coating to maximize the absorption in the active silicon layer of a solar cell.

This problem is a challenging high-dimensional optimization problem with noisy cost functions due to the realistic solar spectrum, and it requires maximizing absorption while addressing trade-offs between reflectance and interference effects.

Use consistent benchmarking and convergence analysis to allocate computational resources effectively. 3. Encourage algorithms to detect and preserve modular structures (e.g., layers with specific roles like anti-reflective or coupling layers). 4. Gradually increase the number of layers during optimization to balance problem complexity and computational cost. 5.

{"role": "LLaMEA", "time": "2025-03-09 06:42:40.702313", "content": "You are a highly skilled computer scientist in the field of natural computing. Your task is to design novel metaheuristic algorithms to solve black box optimization problems.\nThe optimization algorithm should be able to find high-performing solutions to a wide range of tasks, which include evaluation on real-world applications such as, e.g., optimization of multilayered photonic structures. The photovoltaics problem optimizes the design of an antireflective multilayer coating to maximize the absorption in the active silicon layer of a solar cell. The goal is to achieve maximum short-circuit current in the 375 to 750 nm wavelength range. The structure consists of alternating materials with permittivities of 2 and 3, built upon a 30,000 nm thick silicon substrate. Three subcases with increasing complexity are explored, involving 10 layers (photovoltaics), 20 layers (bigphotovoltaics), and 32 layers (hugephotovoltaics). The optimization challenges include balancing high absorption with a low reflectance while addressing the inherent noise and irregularities in the solar spectrum. This problem is a challenging high-dimensional optimization problem with noisy cost functions due to the realistic solar spectrum, and it requires maximizing absorption while addressing trade-offs between reflectance and interference effects. Here are the suggestions for designing algorithms: 1. Combine global methods (e.g., DE, CMA-ES) for exploration with local optimization for refinement. 2. Use consistent benchmarking and convergence analysis to allocate computational resources effectively. 3. Encourage algorithms to detect and preserve modular structures (e.g., layers with specific roles like anti-reflective or coupling layers). 4. Gradually increase the number of layers during optimization to balance problem complexity and computational cost. 5. Integrate robustness metrics into the cost function to ensure the optimized design tolerates small perturbations in layer parameters. Your task is to write the optimization algorithm in Python code. The code should contain an `__init__(self, budget, dim)` function and the function `def __call__(self, func)`, which should optimize the black box function `func` using `self.budget` function evaluations.\nThe func() can only be called as many times as the budget allows, not more. Each of the optimization functions has a search space between func.bounds.lb (lower bound) and func.bounds.ub (upper bound). The dimensionality can be varied.\nGive an excellent and novel heuristic algorithm to solve this task and include it's one-line description with the main idea of the algorithm.\n\nThe current population of algorithms already evaluated (name, description, score) is:\nHybridMetaheuristic: A hybrid metaheuristic combining Differential Evolution for global exploration with Nelder-Mead for local refinement, now with an increased population size for enhanced diversity and exploration efficacy in high-dimensional noisy optimization.

{"role": "LLaMEA", "time": "2025-03-09 11:55:55.133734", "content": "You are a highly skilled computer scientist in the field of natural computing. Your task is to design novel metaheuristic algorithms to solve black box optimization problems.\nThe optimization algorithm should be able to find high-performing solutions to a wide range of tasks, which include evaluation on real-world applications such as, e.g., optimization of multilayered photonic structures. The photovoltaics problem optimizes the design of an antireflective multilayer coating to maximize the absorption in the active silicon layer of a solar cell. The goal is to achieve maximum short-circuit current in the 375 to 750 nm wavelength range. The structure consists of alternating materials with permittivities of 2 and 3, built upon a 30,000 nm thick silicon substrate. Three subcases with increasing complexity are explored, involving 10 layers (photovoltaics), 20 layers (bigphotovoltaics), and 32 layers (hugephotovoltaics). The optimization challenges include balancing high absorption with a low reflectance while addressing the inherent noise and irregularities in the solar spectrum. This problem is a challenging high-dimensional optimization problem with noisy cost functions due to the realistic solar spectrum, and it requires maximizing absorption while addressing trade-offs between reflectance and interference effects. Here are the suggestions for designing algorithms: 1. Combine global methods (e.g., DE, CMA-ES) for exploration with local optimization for refinement. 2. Use consistent benchmarking and convergence analysis to allocate computational resources effectively. 3. Encourage algorithms to detect and preserve modular structures (e.g., layers with specific roles like anti-reflective or coupling layers). 4. Gradually increase the number of layers during optimization to balance problem complexity and computational cost. 5. Integrate robustness metrics into the cost function to ensure the optimized design tolerates small perturbations in layer parameters. Your task is to write the optimization algorithm in Python code. The code should contain an `__init__(self, budget, dim)` function and the function `def __call__(self, func)`, which should optimize the black box function `func` using `self.budget` function evaluations.\nThe func() can only be called as many times as the budget allows, not more. Each of the optimization functions has a search space between func.bounds.lb (lower bound) and func.bounds.ub (upper bound). The dimensionality can be varied.\nGive an excellent and novel heuristic algorithm to solve this task and include it's one-line description with the main idea of the algorithm.\n\nThe current population of algorithms already evaluated (name, description, score) is:\nHybridMetaheuristic: Introduced a dynamic mutation factor in the Differential Evolution algorithm to enhance exploration and exploitation balance.

Your task is to design novel metaheuristic algorithms to solve black box optimization problems.\nThe optimization algorithm should be able to find high-performing solutions to a wide range of tasks, which include evaluation on real-world applications such as, e.g., optimization of multilayered photonic structures. The photovoltaics problem optimizes the design of an antireflective multilayer coating to maximize the absorption in the active silicon layer of a solar cell. The goal is to achieve maximum short-circuit current in the 375 to 750 nm wavelength range. The structure consists of alternating materials with permittivities of 2 and 3, built upon a 30,000 nm thick silicon substrate. Three subcases with increasing complexity are explored, involving 10 layers (photovoltaics), 20 layers (bigphotovoltaics), and 32 layers (hugephotovoltaics). The optimization challenges include balancing high absorption with a low reflectance while addressing the inherent noise and irregularities in the solar spectrum. This problem is a challenging high-dimensional optimization problem with noisy cost functions due to the realistic solar spectrum, and it requires maximizing absorption while addressing trade-offs between reflectance and interference effects. Here are the suggestions for designing algorithms: 1. Combine global methods (e.g., DE, CMA-ES) for exploration with local optimization for refinement. 2. Use consistent benchmarking and convergence analysis to allocate computational resources effectively. 3. Encourage algorithms to detect and preserve modular structures (e.g., layers with specific roles like anti-reflective or coupling layers). 4. Gradually increase the number of layers during optimization to balance problem complexity and computational cost. 5. Integrate robustness metrics into the cost function to ensure the optimized design tolerates small perturbations in layer parameters. Your task is to write the optimization algorithm in Python code. The code should contain an `__init__(self, budget, dim)` function and the function `def __call__(self, func)`, which should optimize the black box function `func` using `self.budget` function evaluations.\nThe func() can only be called as many times as the budget allows, not more.

{"role": "LLaMEA", "time": "2025-03-09 11:55:55.147952", "content": "You are a highly skilled computer scientist in the field of natural computing. Your task is to design novel metaheuristic algorithms to solve black box optimization problems.\nThe optimization algorithm should be able to find high-performing solutions to a wide range of tasks, which include evaluation on real-world applications such as, e.g., optimization of multilayered photonic structures. The photovoltaics problem optimizes the design of an antireflective multilayer coating to maximize the absorption in the active silicon layer of a solar cell. The goal is to achieve maximum short-circuit current in the 375 to 750 nm wavelength range. The structure consists of alternating materials with permittivities of 2 and 3, built upon a 30,000 nm thick silicon substrate. Three subcases with increasing complexity are explored, involving 10 layers (photovoltaics), 20 layers (bigphotovoltaics), and 32 layers (hugephotovoltaics). The optimization challenges include balancing high absorption with a low reflectance while addressing the inherent noise and irregularities in the solar spectrum. This problem is a challenging high-dimensional optimization problem with noisy cost functions due to the realistic solar spectrum, and it requires maximizing absorption while addressing trade-offs between reflectance and interference effects. Here are the suggestions for designing algorithms: 1. Combine global methods (e.g., DE, CMA-ES) for exploration with local optimization for refinement. 2. Use consistent benchmarking and convergence analysis to allocate computational resources effectively. 3. Encourage algorithms to detect and preserve modular structures (e.g., layers with specific roles like anti-reflective or coupling layers). 4. Gradually increase the number of layers during optimization to balance problem complexity and computational cost. 5. Integrate robustness metrics into the cost function to ensure the optimized design tolerates small perturbations in layer parameters. Your task is to write the optimization algorithm in Python code. The code should contain an `__init__(self, budget, dim)` function and the function `def __call__(self, func)`, which should optimize the black box function `func` using `self.budget` function evaluations.\nThe func() can only be called as many times as the budget allows, not more. Each of the optimization functions has a search space between func.bounds.lb (lower bound) and func.bounds.ub (upper bound). The dimensionality can be varied.\nGive an excellent and novel heuristic algorithm to solve this task and include it's one-line description with the main idea of the algorithm.\n\nThe current population of algorithms already evaluated (name, description, score) is:\nHybridMetaheuristic: Introduced a dynamic mutation factor in the Differential Evolution algorithm to enhance exploration and exploitation balance.

The structure consists of alternating materials with permittivities of 2 and 3, built upon a 30,000 nm thick silicon substrate. Three subcases with increasing complexity are explored, involving 10 layers (photovoltaics), 20 layers (bigphotovoltaics), and 32 layers (hugephotovoltaics). The optimization challenges include balancing high absorption with a low reflectance while addressing the inherent noise and irregularities in the solar spectrum. This problem is a challenging high-dimensional optimization problem with noisy cost functions due to the realistic solar spectrum, and it requires maximizing absorption while addressing trade-offs between reflectance and interference effects. Here are the suggestions for designing algorithms: 1. Combine global methods (e.g., DE, CMA-ES) for exploration with local optimization for refinement. 2. Use consistent benchmarking and convergence analysis to allocate computational resources effectively. 3. Encourage algorithms to detect and preserve modular structures (e.g., layers with specific roles like anti-reflective or coupling layers). 4. Gradually increase the number of layers during optimization to balance problem complexity and computational cost. 5. Integrate robustness metrics into the cost function to ensure the optimized design tolerates small perturbations in layer parameters. Your task is to write the optimization algorithm in Python code. The code should contain an `__init__(self, budget, dim)` function and the function `def __call__(self, func)`, which should optimize the black box function `func` using `self.budget` function evaluations.\nThe func() can only be called as many times as the budget allows, not more. Each of the optimization functions has a search space between func.bounds.lb (lower bound) and func.bounds.ub (upper bound). The dimensionality can be varied.\nGive an excellent and novel heuristic algorithm to solve this task and include it's one-line description with the main idea of the algorithm.\n\nThe current population of algorithms already evaluated (name, description, score) is:\nHybridOptimizer: Improved local optimization by increasing max iterations and dynamically adjusting mutation factor for better convergence.

{"role": "LLaMEA", "time": "2025-03-09 19:14:09.303184", "content": "You are a highly skilled computer scientist in the field of natural computing. Your task is to design novel metaheuristic algorithms to solve black box optimization problems.\nThe optimization algorithm should be able to find high-performing solutions to a wide range of tasks, which include evaluation on real-world applications such as, e.g., optimization of multilayered photonic structures. The photovoltaics problem optimizes the design of an antireflective multilayer coating to maximize the absorption in the active silicon layer of a solar cell. The goal is to achieve maximum short-circuit current in the 375 to 750 nm wavelength range. The structure consists of alternating materials with permittivities of 2 and 3, built upon a 30,000 nm thick silicon substrate. Three subcases with increasing complexity are explored, involving 10 layers (photovoltaics), 20 layers (bigphotovoltaics), and 32 layers (hugephotovoltaics). The optimization challenges include balancing high absorption with a low reflectance while addressing the inherent noise and irregularities in the solar spectrum. This problem is a challenging high-dimensional optimization problem with noisy cost functions due to the realistic solar spectrum, and it requires maximizing absorption while addressing trade-offs between reflectance and interference effects. Here are the suggestions for designing algorithms: 1. Combine global methods (e.g., DE, CMA-ES) for exploration with local optimization for refinement. 2. Use consistent benchmarking and convergence analysis to allocate computational resources effectively. 3. Encourage algorithms to detect and preserve modular structures (e.g., layers with specific roles like anti-reflective or coupling layers). 4. Gradually increase the number of layers during optimization to balance problem complexity and computational cost. 5. Integrate robustness metrics into the cost function to ensure the optimized design tolerates small perturbations in layer parameters. Your task is to write the optimization algorithm in Python code. The code should contain an `__init__(self, budget, dim)` function and the function `def __call__(self, func)`, which should optimize the black box function `func` using `self.budget` function evaluations.\nThe func() can only be called as many times as the budget allows, not more. Each of the optimization functions has a search space between func.bounds.lb (lower bound) and func.bounds.ub (upper bound). The dimensionality can be varied.\nGive an excellent and novel heuristic algorithm to solve this task and include it's one-line description with the main idea of the algorithm.\n\nThe current population of algorithms already evaluated (name, description, score) is:\nHybridOptimizer: Improved local optimization by increasing max iterations and dynamically adjusting mutation factor for better convergence.

This problem is a challenging high-dimensional optimization problem with noisy cost functions due to the realistic solar spectrum, and it requires maximizing absorption while addressing trade-offs between reflectance and interference effects.

The goal is to achieve maximum short-circuit current in the 375 to 750 nm wavelength range. The structure consists of alternating materials with permittivities of 2 and 3, built upon a 30,000 nm thick silicon substrate. Three subcases with increasing complexity are explored, involving 10 layers (photovoltaics), 20 layers (bigphotovoltaics), and 32 layers (hugephotovoltaics). The optimization challenges include balancing high absorption with a low reflectance while addressing the inherent noise and irregularities in the solar spectrum. This problem is a challenging high-dimensional optimization problem with noisy cost functions due to the realistic solar spectrum, and it requires maximizing absorption while addressing trade-offs between reflectance and interference effects. Here are the suggestions for designing algorithms: 1. Combine global methods (e.g., DE, CMA-ES) for exploration with local optimization for refinement. 2. Use consistent benchmarking and convergence analysis to allocate computational resources effectively. 3. Encourage algorithms to detect and preserve modular structures (e.g., layers with specific roles like anti-reflective or coupling layers). 4. Gradually increase the number of layers during optimization to balance problem complexity and computational cost. 5. Integrate robustness metrics into the cost function to ensure the optimized design tolerates small perturbations in layer parameters. Your task is to write the optimization algorithm in Python code. The code should contain an `__init__(self, budget, dim)` function and the function `def __call__(self, func)`, which should optimize the black box function `func` using `self.budget` function evaluations.\nThe func() can only be called as many times as the budget allows, not more. Each of the optimization functions has a search space between func.bounds.lb (lower bound) and func.bounds.ub (upper bound). The dimensionality can be varied.\nGive an excellent and novel heuristic algorithm to solve this task and include it's one-line description with the main idea of the algorithm.\n\nThe current population of algorithms already evaluated (name, description, score) is:\nHybridOptimizer: Improved local optimization by increasing max iterations and dynamically adjusting mutation factor for better convergence.

{"role": "LLaMEA", "time": "2025-03-10 05:48:12.318657", "content": "You are a highly skilled computer scientist in the field of natural computing. Your task is to design novel metaheuristic algorithms to solve black box optimization problems.\nThe optimization algorithm should be able to find high-performing solutions to a wide range of tasks, which include evaluation on real-world applications such as, e.g., optimization of multilayered photonic structures. The photovoltaics problem optimizes the design of an antireflective multilayer coating to maximize the absorption in the active silicon layer of a solar cell. The goal is to achieve maximum short-circuit current in the 375 to 750 nm wavelength range. The structure consists of alternating materials with permittivities of 2 and 3, built upon a 30,000 nm thick silicon substrate. Three subcases with increasing complexity are explored, involving 10 layers (photovoltaics), 20 layers (bigphotovoltaics), and 32 layers (hugephotovoltaics). The optimization challenges include balancing high absorption with a low reflectance while addressing the inherent noise and irregularities in the solar spectrum. This problem is a challenging high-dimensional optimization problem with noisy cost functions due to the realistic solar spectrum, and it requires maximizing absorption while addressing trade-offs between reflectance and interference effects. Here are the suggestions for designing algorithms: 1. Combine global methods (e.g., DE, CMA-ES) for exploration with local optimization for refinement. 2. Use consistent benchmarking and convergence analysis to allocate computational resources effectively. 3. Encourage algorithms to detect and preserve modular structures (e.g., layers with specific roles like anti-reflective or coupling layers). 4. Gradually increase the number of layers during optimization to balance problem complexity and computational cost. 5. Integrate robustness metrics into the cost function to ensure the optimized design tolerates small perturbations in layer parameters. Your task is to write the optimization algorithm in Python code. The code should contain an `__init__(self, budget, dim)` function and the function `def __call__(self, func)`, which should optimize the black box function `func` using `self.budget` function evaluations.\nThe func() can only be called as many times as the budget allows, not more. Each of the optimization functions has a search space between func.bounds.lb (lower bound) and func.bounds.ub (upper bound). The dimensionality can be varied.\nGive an excellent and novel heuristic algorithm to solve this task and include it's one-line description with the main idea of the algorithm.\n\nThe current population of algorithms already evaluated (name, description, score) is:\nHybridOptimizer: Improved local optimization by increasing max iterations and dynamically adjusting mutation factor for better convergence.
