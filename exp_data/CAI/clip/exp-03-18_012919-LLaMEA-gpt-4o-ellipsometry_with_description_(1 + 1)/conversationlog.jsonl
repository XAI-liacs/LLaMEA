Your task is to design novel metaheuristic algorithms to solve black box optimization problems.\n    The optimization algorithm should be able to find high-performing solutions to a wide range of tasks, which include evaluation on real-world applications such as, e.g., optimization of multilayered photonic structures. The ellipsometry problem involves retrieving the material and thickness of a reference layer by matching its reflectance properties using a known spectral response. The optimization minimizes the difference between the calculated and measured ellipsometric parameters for wavelengths between 400 and 800 nm and a fixed incidence angle of 40°. The parameters to be optimized include the thickness (30 to 250 nm) and refractive index (1.1 to 3) of the test layer. This relatively straightforward problem models a practical scenario where photonics researchers fine-tune a small number of parameters to achieve a desired spectral fit. Your task is to write the optimization algorithm in Python code. The code should contain an `__init__(self, budget, dim)` function and the function `def __call__(self, func)`, which should optimize the black box function `func` using `self.budget` function evaluations.\n    The func() can only be called as many times as the budget allows, not more. Each of the optimization functions has a search space between func.bounds.lb (lower bound) and func.bounds.ub (upper bound). The dimensionality can be varied.\n    Give an excellent and novel heuristic algorithm to solve this task and include it's one-line description with the main idea of the algorithm.\n    \nThe current population of algorithms already evaluated (name, description, score) is:\nAdaptiveDifferentialRandomWalk: Introduce a dynamic inertia weight and adaptive mutation factor to balance exploration and exploitation, improving convergence speed and solution quality.
