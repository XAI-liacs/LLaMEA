Your task is to design novel metaheuristic algorithms to solve black box optimization problems.\nThe optimization algorithm should be able to find high-performing solutions to a wide range of tasks, which include evaluation on real-world applications such as, e.g., optimization of multilayered photonic structures. The photovoltaics problem optimizes the design of an antireflective multilayer coating to maximize the absorption in the active silicon layer of a solar cell. The goal is to achieve maximum short-circuit current in the 375 to 750 nm wavelength range. The structure consists of alternating materials with permittivities of 2 and 3, built upon a 30,000 nm thick silicon substrate. Three subcases with increasing complexity are explored, involving 10 layers (photovoltaics), 20 layers (bigphotovoltaics), and 32 layers (hugephotovoltaics). The optimization challenges include balancing high absorption with a low reflectance while addressing the inherent noise and irregularities in the solar spectrum. Your task is to write the optimization algorithm in Python code. The code should contain an `__init__(self, budget, dim)` function and the function `def __call__(self, func)`, which should optimize the black box function `func` using `self.budget` function evaluations.\nThe func() can only be called as many times as the budget allows, not more. Each of the optimization functions has a search space between func.bounds.lb (lower bound) and func.bounds.ub (upper bound). The dimensionality can be varied.\nGive an excellent and novel heuristic algorithm to solve this task and include it's one-line description with the main idea of the algorithm.\n\nThe current population of algorithms already evaluated (name, description, score) is:\nAdaptiveSwarmGradientDescent: Introduce stochastic inertia weight based on dynamic global improvements to enhance exploration and convergence.

The photovoltaics problem optimizes the design of an antireflective multilayer coating to maximize the absorption in the active silicon layer of a solar cell.
