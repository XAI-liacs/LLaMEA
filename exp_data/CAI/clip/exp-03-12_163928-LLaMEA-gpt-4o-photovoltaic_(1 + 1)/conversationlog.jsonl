Your task is to design novel metaheuristic algorithms to solve black box optimization problems.\nThe optimization algorithm should be able to find high-performing solutions to a wide range of tasks, which include evaluation on real-world applications such as, e.g., optimization of multilayered photonic structures. Your task is to write the optimization algorithm in Python code. The code should contain an `__init__(self, budget, dim)` function and the function `def __call__(self, func)`, which should optimize the black box function `func` using `self.budget` function evaluations.\nThe func() can only be called as many times as the budget allows, not more. Each of the optimization functions has a search space between func.bounds.lb (lower bound) and func.bounds.ub (upper bound). The dimensionality can be varied.\nGive an excellent and novel heuristic algorithm to solve this task and include it's one-line description with the main idea of the algorithm.\n\nThe current population of algorithms already evaluated (name, description, score) is:\nAdaptiveSwarmGradientDescent: Enhanced Adaptive Swarm Gradient Descent with Dynamic Neighborhood Influence: Introduces a local neighborhood influence factor to refine convergence and explore the search space more efficiently.

Your task is to write the optimization algorithm in Python code. The code should contain an `__init__(self, budget, dim)` function and the function `def __call__(self, func)`, which should optimize the black box function `func` using `self.budget` function evaluations.\nThe func() can only be called as many times as the budget allows, not more. Each of the optimization functions has a search space between func.bounds.lb (lower bound) and func.bounds.ub (upper bound). The dimensionality can be varied.\nGive an excellent and novel heuristic algorithm to solve this task and include it's one-line description with the main idea of the algorithm.\n\nThe current population of algorithms already evaluated (name, description, score) is:\nAdaptiveSwarmGradientDescent: Enhanced Adaptive Swarm Gradient Descent with Dynamic Neighborhood Influence: Introduces a local neighborhood influence factor to refine convergence and explore the search space more efficiently.

Make sure you only change 18.0% of the code, which means if the code has 100 lines, you can only change 18.0327868852459 lines, and the rest of the lines should remain unchanged. This input code has 61 lines, so you can only change 11 lines, the rest 50 lines should remain unchanged. This changing rate 18.0% is the mandatory requirement, you cannot change more or less than this rate.\n\n\nProvide the Python code and a one-line description with the main idea (without enters).
