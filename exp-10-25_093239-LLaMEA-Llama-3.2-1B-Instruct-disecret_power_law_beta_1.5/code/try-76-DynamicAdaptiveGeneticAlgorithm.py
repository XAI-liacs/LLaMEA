# One-line description: "Dynamic Adaptive Genetic Algorithm with Adaptive Sampling and Mutation"
# This algorithm uses adaptive sampling to select the next individual based on the fitness and the dimension,
# and ensures the fitness stays within the bounds to prevent overfitting.
# It also applies a small mutation to refine the strategy.
